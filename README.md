# Operating Systems Project

Operating system built from sratch on x86 architecture with a custom bootloader. I used the Linux subsystem in Windows to run, 
develop and test my system. Included is the source code for the project, alongside binaries and other compilation files.

To run, ensure that nasm, qemu, and i386-based gcc compilers and linkers are installed. Or, just run MOS.bin in your emulator of choice.

Work in progress.
